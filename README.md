# Kendo UI Test

> The code is not complete because of lack of time.

## Instructions


### Using Kendo UI MVVM (Kendo List View, Kendo Data Source, Kendo Data Model), do the next:

1. Take the JSON structure and store it in a Kendo Data Source.
2. Display a search bar, where user can look for the items saved in point 1(Search must be applied after every key press).
3. Generate a resume section, where the app will display the items selected by user in point 2.
4. Resume section will allow the user to update quantity by enter the digit manually or by add and decrease using buttons (+ / - ).
6. Totals must be updated after every quantity update.
7. Add a button ('Clear'). Once user hits it, the cart must be cleaned.
8. If user select 3 or more items, display a Kendo UI Modal where you display a promotion and apply 10% of discount.
9. Only available items can be added into cart.
10. Add proper validations for every math operation.
11. Display error messages as per convenience.
12. Feel free to style as you desire.


### Points to Review: 

* Use MVVM.
* Use Kendo Observables.
* Use one Kendo Data Source to store JSON data and another Kendo Data Source to store cart items.
* Style will be evaluated.
* Code structure will be evaluated.
* Code standards should be applied.
